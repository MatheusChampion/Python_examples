# 🐍 Python Exercises Collection: Python_Examples! 🚀

During my Python course in college, I built a collection of small but useful Python exercises to practice coding fundamentals and problem-solving. This project includes a variety of applications such as:

📌 Tax Calculator – Automates tax calculations based on given inputs.

🎲 Dice Roller – Simulates rolling dice for games or random number generation.

🍾 99 Bottles – A fun program that generates the classic “99 Bottles of Beer” song.

🖼 Pic Crack – A simple image-processing script.

💰 Change Calculator – Helps break down currency into smaller denominations.

This project was a great way to improve my Python skills, understand logic flow, and get hands-on experience with different applications. It helped me solidify key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

I’m excited to keep adding more exercises and refining my skills as I continue my journey in Python development! If you’re interested in Python or beginner-friendly projects, feel free to check it out! 🚀🐍
